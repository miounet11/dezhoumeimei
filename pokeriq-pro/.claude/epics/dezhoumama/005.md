# Task 005: Performance Optimization & Quality Assurance

## Overview

Implement comprehensive performance optimization strategies and quality assurance processes to ensure the dezhoumama platform delivers exceptional user experience at scale. This includes code optimization, caching strategies, monitoring systems, testing frameworks, and quality gates to maintain high standards throughout development.

## Technical Requirements

### Performance Optimization
- Frontend bundle optimization and code splitting
- Database query optimization and indexing
- CDN integration for static assets
- Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- Image and video optimization pipelines
- Lazy loading for content and components
- Service worker implementation for offline capabilities

### Quality Assurance Framework  
- Automated testing pipeline (unit, integration, e2e)
- Performance monitoring and alerting
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Code quality gates and linting
- Accessibility compliance testing
- Cross-browser compatibility validation
- Load testing for high traffic scenarios

### Monitoring and Analytics
- Application performance monitoring (APM)
- User experience tracking and analytics
- Error tracking and debugging tools
- Database performance monitoring
- Infrastructure health monitoring
- Business metrics and KPI tracking

## Implementation Details

### Performance Optimizations
```typescript
// Code splitting and lazy loading
const CoursePlayer = lazy(() => import('./CoursePlayer'));
const Dashboard = lazy(() => import('./Dashboard'));

// Image optimization with Next.js
import Image from 'next/image';
<Image src={courseImage} width={300} height={200} placeholder="blur" />

// Database query optimization
// Add proper indexes for frequently queried columns
// Implement query result caching with Redis
// Use connection pooling for database connections
```

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: 80%+ code coverage requirement
- Integration tests: API endpoints and database operations
- E2E tests: Critical user journeys and workflows
- Performance tests: Load testing under expected traffic
- Security tests: OWASP compliance and vulnerability scanning

## Effort Estimation
