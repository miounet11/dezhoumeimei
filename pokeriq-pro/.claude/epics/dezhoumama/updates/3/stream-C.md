# Stream C: Data Validation & Business Logic

## Scope
Input validation, business rules, and data integrity for dezhoumama learning platform

## Files
- `lib/validation/courses.ts`
- `lib/validation/assessments.ts`
- `lib/validation/progress.ts`
- `lib/business/course-progression.ts`
- `lib/business/assessment-scoring.ts`

## Progress
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Course validation logic (`lib/validation/courses.ts`)
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Assessment validation with complex JSON structures (`lib/validation/assessments.ts`) 
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Progress validation with completion rates and study time (`lib/validation/progress.ts`)
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Course progression business logic (`lib/business/course-progression.ts`)
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Assessment scoring algorithms with weighted scoring (`lib/business/assessment-scoring.ts`)

## Implementation Summary

### Validation Layer (`lib/validation/`)

1. **Course Validation (`courses.ts`)**:
   - Title, level, prerequisites, tags, duration, and URL validation
   - Business rule validation for title uniqueness and prerequisite chains
   - Comprehensive error handling with specific error codes
   - Support for create/update operations and filters

2. **Assessment Validation (`assessments.ts`)**:
   - Complex JSON structure validation for questions and scoring configs  
   - Question type validation (multiple-choice, true-false, short-answer, essay, scenario)
   - Scoring configuration validation with weightings, penalties, and bonuses
   - Assessment answer validation and user assessment creation
   - Cross-validation for total points matching

3. **Progress Validation (`progress.ts`)**:
   - Completion rate validation (0-100% with 2 decimal precision)
   - Study time validation with reasonable limits
   - Test score structure validation with skill breakdown
   - Chat message and personality config validation for character system
   - Progress filter validation for analytics queries

### Business Logic Layer (`lib/business/`)

1. **Course Progression (`course-progression.ts`)**:
   - **PrerequisiteManager**: Dependency checking, graph building, chain validation
   - **CompletionTracker**: Multi-criteria completion checking with weighted scoring
   - **LearningPathManager**: Dynamic path generation, skill track creation, optimal sequencing
   - **ProgressAnalytics**: Comprehensive learning analytics with trend analysis

2. **Assessment Scoring (`assessment-scoring.ts`)**:
   - **AssessmentScoringEngine**: Weighted scoring with accuracy, speed, and difficulty components
   - **PerformanceAnalyzer**: Multi-assessment analysis with difficulty handling metrics  
   - **AdaptiveScoring**: Dynamic scoring adjustment based on user performance history
   - Sophisticated bonus/penalty system with skill breakdown generation

## Key Features Implemented

### Data Validation
- Input sanitization and normalization
- Comprehensive error reporting with specific error codes  
- Business rule enforcement (uniqueness, circular dependencies)
- Cross-field validation and data integrity checks
- Complex JSON structure validation for assessments and personality configs

### Business Logic
- Prerequisite dependency graphs with circular dependency detection
- Multi-criteria course completion with configurable thresholds
- Weighted assessment scoring (accuracy 60%, assessments 30%, time 10%)
- Dynamic learning path generation based on user progress and goals  
- Skill analysis and performance metrics with improvement recommendations
- Adaptive scoring that adjusts to user performance history

## Architecture Patterns Used
- Validation Result pattern for consistent error handling
- Strategy pattern for different scoring algorithms
- Factory pattern for completion criteria based on course level
- Builder pattern for learning path construction
- Analytics pattern for performance measurement

## Dependencies Met
- Uses TypeScript types from Stream B (`lib/types/dezhoumama.ts`)
- Integrates with existing project patterns and validation approaches
- Compatible with Prisma schema and existing database queries
- Follows project naming conventions and file organization

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**  
**Actual Hours**: 6  
**Dependencies**: Stream B (TypeScript types) - ✅ Available
