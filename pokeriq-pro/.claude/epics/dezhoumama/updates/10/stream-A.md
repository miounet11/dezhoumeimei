## âœ… Completed Tasks

### 1. Extended Prisma Schema âœ…
- **File Modified:** `prisma/schema.prisma`
- **Changes:**
  - Added `UserPreferences` model for learning style and training preferences
  - Added `PersonalizationProfile` model for skill assessment and user profiling
  - Added `RecommendationHistory` model for tracking recommendation effectiveness
  - Added `LearningPath` model for personalized training curricula
  - Added `ABTestParticipation` model for experiment tracking
  - Added new enums: `RecommendationStatus`, `LearningPathStatus`, `ABTestStatus`
  - Added relationships to existing `User` model

### 2. Created Database Query Layer âœ…
- **New Files:**
  - `lib/db/queries/personalization-queries.ts` - User preferences and profiles
  - `lib/db/queries/recommendation-queries.ts` - Recommendation history and analytics
  - `lib/db/queries/learning-path-queries.ts` - Learning path management

- **Key Features:**
  - Type-safe database operations
  - Data conversion utilities between API and database formats
  - Comprehensive CRUD operations
  - Analytics and statistics queries
  - Error handling and validation

### 3. Enhanced API Endpoints âœ…
- **Modified:** `app/api/user/profile/route.ts`
  - Integrated personalization data into user profiles
  - Added skill profiles, preferences, and recommendation stats
  - Maintained backward compatibility

- **Modified:** `app/api/training/recommendations/route.ts`
  - Integrated database-driven user profiles
  - Uses real user preferences for recommendation context
  - Marked as legacy, recommends new endpoints

### 4. Created New Personalization APIs âœ…
- **New Files:**
  - `app/api/personalization/preferences/route.ts`
    - GET: Fetch user preferences with defaults
    - PUT: Update user preferences with validation
    - DELETE: Reset preferences to defaults
  
  - `app/api/personalization/recommendations/route.ts`
    - GET: Generate personalized recommendations using database profiles
    - POST: Record user feedback (accept/decline)
    - PUT: Mark recommendations as completed with effectiveness data
  
  - `app/api/personalization/learning-path/route.ts`
    - GET: Fetch user learning paths and progress
    - POST: Create new personalized learning paths
    - PUT: Update path status and progress
    - DELETE: Remove learning paths

### 5. Integrated Existing Services âœ…
- **PersonalizationEngine Integration:**
  - Connected to database via query layer
  - Uses real user profiles instead of mock data
  - Maintains existing API compatibility

- **UserProfiler Integration:**
  - Database storage for skill assessments
  - Real-time profile updates
  - Historical tracking capabilities

### 6. Created Migration and Seed Data âœ…
- **Files Created:**
  - `prisma/migrations/add_personalization_system.sql` - Database schema migration
  - `prisma/seed-personalization.ts` - Comprehensive seed data
  - `scripts/setup-personalization.sh` - Setup automation script

- **Seed Data Includes:**
  - Demo user with complete personalization profile
  - Realistic skill assessments and learning preferences
  - 5 recommendation history records with various statuses
  - Active learning path with 3-stage progression
  - AB test participation for algorithm enhancement
  - Performance indexes and analysis views

## ðŸ“Š Database Schema Overview

### Core Tables
1. **user_preferences** - Learning styles, goals, time availability
2. **personalization_profiles** - Skill ratings, weaknesses, learning velocity
3. **recommendation_history** - Recommendation tracking and effectiveness
4. **learning_paths** - Personalized training curricula and progress
5. **ab_test_participation** - Experiment tracking and metrics

### Key Relationships
- All tables linked to `users` with CASCADE delete
- Comprehensive indexing for performance
- JSONB fields for flexible data storage
- Optimized for analytics queries

## ðŸš€ API Endpoints Summary

### Enhanced Endpoints
- `GET /api/user/profile` - Now includes personalization data
- `GET /api/training/recommendations` - Uses database profiles

### New Personalization Endpoints
- `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/personalization/preferences` - User preferences management
- `GET/POST/PUT /api/personalization/recommendations` - Recommendation system
- `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/personalization/learning-path` - Learning path management

## ðŸ§ª Testing & Setup

### Setup Script
- `scripts/setup-personalization.sh` - Automated setup with verification
- Includes API testing script generation
- Comprehensive status reporting

### Demo Data
- Complete personalization profile for `demo-user-id`
- Various recommendation statuses for testing
- Active learning path with realistic progress
- AB test participation for algorithm validation

## ðŸ“ˆ Performance Optimizations

### Database Indexes
- User-specific indexes for fast lookups
- Composite indexes for analytics queries
- JSONB indexes for flexible data queries
