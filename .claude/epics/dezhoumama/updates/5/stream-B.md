## Technical Implementation Notes

### Dependencies Used
- Recharts for chart components
- D3.js for advanced calculations (already installed)
- Custom SVG components for progress rings
- Existing analytics service integration

### Key Features
1. **Responsive Design**: All components adapt to screen size
2. **Interactive Charts**: Hover effects, tooltips, and legends
3. **Data Integration**: Real API calls with fallback mock data
4. **Performance Optimized**: Memoization and efficient re-renders
5. **Accessibility**: WCAG compliant color schemes and interactions
6. **Modular Architecture**: Reusable chart configurations
7. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation

### Component Architecture
- Modular design with reusable sub-components
- Props-based configuration for flexibility
- Consistent styling and theming
- Error boundaries and loading states
- Mobile-first responsive design

## Integration Notes
Components are ready for integration into the main dashboard. They:
- Follow existing project patterns and conventions
- Integrate with the established analytics service
- Use the existing logger and error handling
- Are fully responsive and accessible
- Include comprehensive TypeScript types

## Next Steps for Integration
1. Import components into main dashboard layout
2. Configure routing for the dashboard pages
3. Set up user authentication checks
4. Add any additional data sources as needed
5. Customize styling to match final design system
