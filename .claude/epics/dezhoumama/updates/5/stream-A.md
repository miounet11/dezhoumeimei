# Stream A: Analytics Foundation

## Scope
Backend analytics services, API endpoints, and data processing

## Files
- `pokeriq-pro/lib/dashboard/analytics-service.ts`
- `pokeriq-pro/lib/dashboard/aggregations.ts`
- `pokeriq-pro/lib/dashboard/metrics-calculator.ts`
- `pokeriq-pro/app/api/dashboard/analytics/[userId]/route.ts`
- `pokeriq-pro/app/api/dashboard/progress/summary/route.ts`

## Progress

### Completed ✅

  - Performance metrics and trend analysis 
  - Skill progression analytics with confidence intervals
  - Study pattern analysis with consistency metrics
  - Assessment performance tracking with category breakdown

- **Aggregations Service** (`aggregations.ts`) 
  - Data aggregation with Redis caching strategies
  - User, course, and global aggregates with TTL management
  - Batch cache updates and invalidation
  - Leaderboard generation and maintenance
  - Performance trend calculations (weekly/monthly)

- **Metrics Calculator** (`metrics-calculator.ts`)
  - Advanced performance metrics with statistical analysis
  - Skill mastery calculations with trend analysis
  - Learning efficiency metrics (time, accuracy, retention, practice)
  - Progress velocity tracking with predictions
  - Engagement score calculation with pattern analysis
  - Retention prediction with risk assessment
  - Competency gap identification and roadmap generation

- **User Analytics API** (`/api/dashboard/analytics/[userId]`)
  - Multiple analytics types: overview, detailed, trends, skills, performance, engagement
  - Query parameter validation with Zod schemas
