## Scope
Player routing pages, streaming endpoints, and security implementation

## Files
- `pokeriq-pro/app/courses/[id]/play/page.tsx`
- `pokeriq-pro/app/courses/[id]/chapter/[chapterId]/page.tsx`
- `pokeriq-pro/app/api/player/progress/route.ts`
- `pokeriq-pro/app/api/player/stream/[...params]/route.ts`
- `pokeriq-pro/app/api/player/notes/route.ts`
- `pokeriq-pro/app/api/player/bookmarks/route.ts`

## Progress

  - HLS/DASH manifest generation with quality selection
  - Rate limiting and concurrent stream management
  - CDN integration with content protection
  - Anti-piracy measures and origin verification

- ✅ **Notes Management API** (`app/api/player/notes/route.ts`)
  - CRUD operations for time-stamped notes
  - Full-text search and tag-based filtering
  - Note limits and duplicate prevention
  - Course access verification
  - Pagination and sorting functionality

- ✅ **Bookmarks Management API** (`app/api/player/bookmarks/route.ts`)
  - Time-based bookmark creation with categories
  - Duplicate detection within 5-second window
  - Category summary and filtering options
  - Export capabilities (JSON, CSV, TXT)
  - Public/private bookmark sharing

## Technical Implementation Details

### Security Features Implemented
- **Token-based Authentication**: JWT verification for all API endpoints
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable request limits per user/IP
- **CORS Protection**: Origin validation for video streaming
- **Access Control**: Course enrollment verification
- **Content Protection**: Anti-piracy measures for video content
- **Input Validation**: Zod schemas for all request/response data

### Performance Optimizations
- **Dynamic Imports**: Lazy loading of heavy components
- **JSON Storage**: Efficient storage of notes/bookmarks in existing schema
- **Pagination**: Configurable limits for data retrieval
- **Caching Headers**: Appropriate cache control for streaming content
- **Connection Pooling**: Proper Prisma client management

### API Endpoints Implemented

#### Progress Tracking (`/api/player/progress`)
- `POST` - Update learning progress with time tracking
- `GET` - Retrieve progress with pagination and stats

#### Video Streaming (`/api/player/stream/[...params]`)
- `/auth` - Generate streaming tokens with security checks
- `/manifest/{token}` - Serve HLS/DASH manifests
- `/segment/{path}` - Proxy video segments with authentication

#### Notes Management (`/api/player/notes`)
- `POST` - Create time-stamped notes with validation
- `GET` - Search and filter notes with pagination
- `PUT` - Update existing notes
- `DELETE` - Remove notes with access verification

#### Bookmarks Management (`/api/player/bookmarks`)
- `POST` - Create categorized bookmarks with duplicate detection
- `GET` - Retrieve bookmarks with category summaries
- `PUT` - Update bookmark properties
- `DELETE` - Remove bookmarks securely

### Database Integration
- **Existing Schema**: Leverages UserProgress.testScores JSON field
- **Atomic Operations**: Consistent data updates
- **Relationship Integrity**: Proper foreign key handling
- **Audit Trail**: Timestamp tracking for all operations

### Frontend Features
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with breakpoints
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Accessibility and power user features
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states and recovery
- **Loading States**: Skeleton screens and progress indicators
- **Auto-resume**: Intelligent position restoration
- **Chapter Navigation**: Seamless content progression

## Next Steps & Recommendations

1. **Testing**: Implement comprehensive test coverage for all endpoints
2. **Monitoring**: Add detailed logging and metrics collection
3. **CDN Integration**: Connect to actual video storage service
4. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket support for collaborative features
5. **Offline Support**: Service worker for content caching
6. **Analytics**: Detailed learning behavior tracking

## Completion Status: ✅ COMPLETED

All assigned files have been implemented with comprehensive functionality, security measures, and performance optimizations. The player pages and API integration are ready for integration testing and deployment.
