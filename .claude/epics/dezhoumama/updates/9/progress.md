# Issue #9 - Virtual Character System Progress

## Overview
Implementation of the Virtual Character System for dezhoumama learning platform.

**Start Date:** 2025-08-26
**Status:** In Progress
**Estimated Hours:** 50-60 hours

## Requirements Summary
- Character conversation interface with real-time chat
- AI-powered character responses with personality
- Character selection and management
- Conversation history and context tracking
- Real-time WebSocket/SSE messaging
- Integration with existing LearningCharacter and ChatSession models

## Progress Tracking

### Completed Tasks
- ‚úÖ Analyzed existing database schema and found LearningCharacter and ChatSession models already implemented
- ‚úÖ Verified existing query functions in lib/db/queries/characters.ts and chat.ts
- ‚úÖ Set up project task tracking

### Current Tasks
- üîÑ Creating progress tracking file

### Pending Tasks
- ‚è≥ Create character conversation API endpoints in app/api/characters/
- ‚è≥ Create chat conversation API endpoints in app/api/chat/
- ‚è≥ Build character personality engine in lib/character/
- ‚è≥ Build conversation management system in lib/chat/
- ‚è≥ Create character selection interface components
- ‚è≥ Build real-time chat interface components
- ‚è≥ Create character interaction pages in app/characters/
- ‚è≥ Implement WebSocket/SSE for real-time messaging
- ‚è≥ Test the complete character system integration

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Database Schema Status
‚úÖ **Already Implemented:**
- `LearningCharacter` model with personality config, avatars, specialization
- `ChatSession` model for conversation management
- Comprehensive query functions for both models
- Support for character skill levels, conversation styles, etc.

### Architecture Decisions
- **Real-time Communication:** Will implement using Server-Sent Events (SSE) for simplicity and better browser compatibility
- **Character Personality:** Will use the existing personalityConfig JSON field to drive AI responses
- **Message Storage:** Will leverage the existing conversationHistory JSON field in ChatSession
- **Context Management:** Will use the existing contextData field for conversation context

## Next Steps
1. Complete progress tracking setup
2. Start with character personality engine implementation
3. Build API endpoints for character interaction
4. Implement real-time chat interface
5. Create character selection pages
6. Add WebSocket/SSE for real-time updates
7. Comprehensive testing and integration

## Notes
- Existing database models provide excellent foundation
- Query functions are comprehensive and production-ready
- Focus will be on frontend components and real-time communication
- Character personality system needs to interpret existing JSON configs
