# Stream A: File Extension Analysis & Fixes

## Scope
- Scan all `.js` files for JSX syntax patterns
- Identify files that need renaming to `.tsx`
- Generate list of required changes
- Update import statements after renaming

## Files
- `**/*.js` (scan and potentially rename)
- Any files importing renamed components
- Package.json scripts if needed

## Progress
- ✅ COMPLETED: All .js files analyzed for JSX syntax patterns
- ✅ Result: 0 files contain JSX requiring .tsx extension
- ✅ All files are correctly named and contain pure JavaScript
- ✅ No import statements need updating
