# Task 004: Assessment Engine

## Overview

Build a comprehensive assessment system that evaluates poker skills through interactive quizzes, scenario-based testing, and integration with existing GTO evaluation algorithms. This system will provide real-time feedback and skill scoring to drive personalized learning paths.

## Technical Requirements

### Core Components

#### Quiz System
- Interactive question types (multiple choice, scenario-based, hand history analysis)
- Real-time feedback with explanations
- Adaptive difficulty based on user performance
- Time-based challenges and pressure scenarios

#### Skill Evaluation Framework
```typescript
interface SkillAssessment {
  skillCategories: {
    preflop: number;
    postflop: number;
    betting: number;
    reading: number;
    gto: number;
    psychology: number;
  };
  overallRating: number;
  confidenceLevel: number;
  recommendedAreas: string[];
}
```

#### Scoring Algorithms
- Weighted scoring based on question difficulty and response time
- Statistical analysis of performance patterns
- Integration with existing GTO solver for hand evaluation accuracy
- Comparative scoring against skill benchmarks

### Database Schema Extensions

```sql
-- Assessment configuration
CREATE TABLE assessments (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  course_id INTEGER REFERENCES courses(id),
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  difficulty_level INTEGER CHECK (difficulty_level BETWEEN 1 AND 5),
  time_limit INTEGER, -- seconds
  passing_score DECIMAL(5,2),
  question_count INTEGER,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Question bank
CREATE TABLE assessment_questions (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  assessment_id INTEGER REFERENCES assessments(id),
  question_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- 'multiple_choice', 'scenario', 'hand_analysis'
  question_data JSONB NOT NULL,
  correct_answers JSONB NOT NULL,
  difficulty_weight DECIMAL(3,2) DEFAULT 1.0,
  explanation TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- User test results
CREATE TABLE user_assessments (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  assessment_id INTEGER REFERENCES assessments(id),
  score DECIMAL(5,2),
  time_taken INTEGER, -- seconds
  answers JSONB,
  skill_breakdown JSONB,
  completed_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### API Endpoints

#### Assessment Management
```typescript
// Assessment CRUD operations
GET /api/assessments?courseId={id}&difficulty={level}
GET /api/assessments/{assessmentId}
POST /api/assessments/{assessmentId}/start
PUT /api/assessments/{assessmentId}/submit
GET /api/assessments/{assessmentId}/results/{userId}

// Question management
GET /api/assessments/{assessmentId}/questions
POST /api/assessments/{assessmentId}/questions/{questionId}/answer
```

#### Skill Analytics
```typescript
// Performance tracking
GET /api/users/{userId}/skill-profile
GET /api/users/{userId}/assessment-history
POST /api/assessments/analyze-performance
GET /api/assessments/leaderboard?timeframe={period}
```

### Frontend Components

#### Assessment Interface
- Clean, distraction-free testing environment
- Progress indicator and timer display
- Question navigation and review capabilities
- Mobile-responsive design for tablet/phone usage

#### Hand Analysis Component
```tsx
interface HandAnalysisProps {
  handHistory: HandHistory;
  question: string;
  options: AnalysisOption[];
  onAnswer: (answer: string, reasoning?: string) => void;
}

const HandAnalysisQuestion: React.FC<HandAnalysisProps> = ({ ... }) => {
  // Interactive poker table visualization
  // Action selection interface
  // GTO comparison display
};
```

#### Results Dashboard
- Detailed score breakdown by skill category
- Performance trend visualization
- Personalized improvement recommendations
- Social comparison features (anonymous)

### Integration with GTO System

#### Real-time Hand Evaluation
- Leverage existing GTO solver for answer validation
- Compare user decisions against optimal strategy
- Provide EV calculations for alternative actions
- Generate explanations for correct/incorrect choices

#### Adaptive Testing Algorithm
```python
class AdaptiveAssessment:
    def __init__(self, user_skill_profile):
        self.user_profile = user_skill_profile
        self.question_pool = self.load_questions()
        
    def select_next_question(self, previous_answers):
        # Difficulty adjustment based on performance
        # Skill area focusing based on weak points
        # Question variety to maintain engagement
        
    def calculate_skill_rating(self, assessment_results):
        # Statistical modeling of user abilities
        # Confidence interval calculation
        # Skill progression tracking
```

## Performance Requirements

- Question loading: ≤ 200ms
- Answer submission processing: ≤ 500ms
