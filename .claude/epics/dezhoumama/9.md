# Task 005: Virtual Character System

## Overview

Develop an AI-powered virtual character conversation system that provides personalized poker coaching through interactive chat interfaces. This system extends the existing AI opponent framework to include conversational avatars with distinct personalities, specializations, and teaching styles.

## Technical Requirements

### Core Components

#### AI Conversation Engine
- Natural language processing for poker-specific conversations
- Context-aware responses based on user skill level and progress
- Multi-turn conversation memory and state management
- Integration with existing AI opponent personality systems

#### Character Personality Framework
```typescript
interface VirtualCharacter {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  personality: {
    teaching_style: 'analytical' | 'encouraging' | 'challenging' | 'casual';
    expertise_areas: SkillArea[];
    communication_tone: 'formal' | 'friendly' | 'direct' | 'humorous';
    difficulty_preference: 'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced' | 'mixed';
  };
  avatar: {
    image_url: string;
    animation_config: AnimationSettings;
    voice_profile?: VoiceSettings;
  };
  conversation_config: {
    response_patterns: ResponsePattern[];
    fallback_responses: string[];
    topic_transitions: TopicTransition[];
  };
}
```

#### Chat Interface System
- Real-time messaging with WebSocket support
- Rich content support (text, images, hand histories, charts)
- Conversation history persistence and search
- Mobile-optimized chat UI with avatar animations

### Database Schema Extensions

```sql
-- Virtual character definitions
CREATE TABLE characters (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  personality_config JSONB NOT NULL,
  avatar_config JSONB NOT NULL,
  specialization_areas TEXT[],
  active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Chat session management
CREATE TABLE chat_sessions (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  character_id INTEGER REFERENCES characters(id),
  context_data JSONB, -- current course, skill level, etc.
  session_start TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  last_activity TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true
);

-- Conversation history
CREATE TABLE chat_messages (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  session_id INTEGER REFERENCES chat_sessions(id),
  sender_type VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL CHECK (sender_type IN ('user', 'character')),
  message_content JSONB NOT NULL,
  message_type VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'text', -- 'text', 'hand_analysis', 'image', 'suggestion'
  timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Character interaction analytics
CREATE TABLE character_interactions (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  character_id INTEGER REFERENCES characters(id),
  interaction_type VARCHAR(50), -- 'question', 'lesson', 'analysis', 'encouragement'
  user_satisfaction INTEGER CHECK (user_satisfaction BETWEEN 1 AND 5),
  conversation_length INTEGER, -- number of exchanges
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### AI Service Architecture

#### Conversation Service
```python
class ConversationEngine:
    def __init__(self, character_config, user_profile):
        self.character = character_config
        self.user = user_profile
        self.conversation_memory = ConversationMemory()
        
    async def generate_response(self, user_message, context):
        """
        Generate contextually appropriate response based on:
        - Character personality and expertise
        - User skill level and learning progress
        - Current conversation context
        - Learning objectives and goals
        """
        
    async def analyze_user_intent(self, message):
        """
        Classify user message intent:
        - Question about strategy
        - Hand analysis request
        - General conversation
        - Help/support request
        """
        
    async def recommend_topics(self, user_progress):
        """
        Suggest conversation topics based on:
        - Learning gaps identified in assessments
        - User's current course progress
        - Character's areas of expertise
        """
```

#### Character Management API
```typescript
// Character interaction endpoints
GET /api/characters?specialization={area}&difficulty={level}
GET /api/characters/{characterId}
POST /api/chat/sessions/start
GET /api/chat/sessions/{sessionId}/history
POST /api/chat/sessions/{sessionId}/message
WebSocket /api/chat/live/{sessionId}

// Character analytics
GET /api/characters/{characterId}/analytics
POST /api/characters/{characterId}/feedback
GET /api/users/{userId}/character-interactions
```

### Frontend Components

#### Character Selection Interface
```tsx
interface CharacterCardProps {
  character: VirtualCharacter;
  userSkillLevel: SkillLevel;
  recommendedMatch: boolean;
  onSelect: (characterId: string) => void;
}

const CharacterCard: React.FC<CharacterCardProps> = ({ 
  character, 
  userSkillLevel, 
  recommendedMatch, 
  onSelect 
}) => {
  return (
    <div className={`character-card ${recommendedMatch ? 'recommended' : ''}`}>
      <Avatar src={character.avatar.image_url} animated />
      <div className="character-info">
        <h3>{character.name}</h3>
        <SpecializationTags areas={character.personality.expertise_areas} />
        <CompatibilityScore user={userSkillLevel} character={character} />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

#### Real-time Chat Component
```tsx
interface ChatInterfaceProps {
  sessionId: string;
  character: VirtualCharacter;
  onMessageSent: (message: string) => void;
}

const ChatInterface: React.FC<ChatInterfaceProps> = ({ 
  sessionId, 
  character, 
  onMessageSent 
}) => {
  const { messages, sendMessage, isTyping } = useWebSocketChat(sessionId);
  
  return (
    <div className="chat-container">
      <CharacterHeader character={character} />
      <MessageList messages={messages} />
      <TypingIndicator visible={isTyping} character={character} />
      <MessageInput onSend={sendMessage} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

#### Hand Analysis Integration
```tsx
const HandAnalysisChat: React.FC<{ handHistory: HandHistory }> = ({ handHistory }) => {
  return (
    <div className="hand-analysis-container">
      <PokerTableVisualization hand={handHistory} />
      <CharacterAnalysis>
        <Avatar character={currentCharacter} />
        <AnalysisContent>
          "Let's break down this hand together. What was your thinking on the flop?"
        </AnalysisContent>
        <ActionSuggestions suggestions={gtoSuggestions} />
      </CharacterAnalysis>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Character Personality Implementation

#### Teaching Style Algorithms
```python
class TeachingStyleManager:
    def adapt_response_style(self, character_personality, user_progress, message_context):
        """
        Adapt response based on character's teaching approach:
        - Analytical: Provide detailed explanations with math/statistics
        - Encouraging: Focus on positive reinforcement and motivation
        - Challenging: Ask probing questions, present difficult scenarios
        - Casual: Use informal language, relate to everyday experiences
        """
        
    def select_explanation_depth(self, user_skill_level, topic_complexity):
        """
        Adjust explanation complexity based on:
        - User's demonstrated skill level
        - Topic difficulty and prerequisites
        - Character's preferred communication style
        """
```

#### Conversation Context Management
```python
class ConversationMemory:
    def __init__(self):
        self.short_term = {}  # Current session context
        self.long_term = {}   # User relationship history
        self.topic_history = []  # Recent discussion topics
        
    def update_context(self, user_message, character_response):
        """
        Maintain conversation continuity:
        - Track discussed topics and concepts
        - Remember user's questions and confusions
        - Note successful teaching moments
        - Identify recurring challenges
        """
```
