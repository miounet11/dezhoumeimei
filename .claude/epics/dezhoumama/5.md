# Task 007: Progress Dashboard

## Overview

Build comprehensive analytics, visualization, and social features dashboard to track user learning progress, course completion, assessment performance, and provide social engagement features for the dezhoumama learning platform.

## Technical Requirements

### Dashboard Components
- **Learning Analytics**: Course completion rates, time spent, skill progression tracking
- **Performance Visualization**: Interactive charts showing assessment scores, skill development over time
- **Social Features**: Progress sharing, leaderboards, peer comparison, achievement badges
- **Recommendation Display**: Personalized course suggestions based on performance data
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bars, milestone achievements, learning streaks

### Frontend Implementation
```typescript
// Dashboard components structure
/components/dashboard/
├── LearningAnalytics.tsx     // Progress charts and metrics
├── PerformanceCharts.tsx     // Skill progression visualization  
├── SocialFeatures.tsx        // Leaderboards, sharing, achievements
├── ProgressTracker.tsx       // Course/assessment progress displays
├── RecommendationPanel.tsx   // Personalized learning suggestions
└── DashboardLayout.tsx       // Main dashboard container

// Dashboard API endpoints
/api/dashboard/analytics/[userId]     // Learning analytics data
/api/dashboard/social/leaderboard     // Social features data
/api/dashboard/progress/summary       // Progress summary
/api/dashboard/achievements/[userId]  // User achievements
```

### Backend Services
```python
# Analytics service endpoints
/ai/analytics/learning-path/{userId}      # Learning path analysis
/ai/analytics/skill-progression/{userId}  # Skill development tracking
/ai/analytics/performance-trends/{userId} # Performance trend analysis
/ai/social/peer-comparison/{userId}       # Peer performance comparison
```

### Database Schema Extensions
```sql
-- Analytics and social features tables
user_analytics (
  user_id INT,
  course_completion_rate DECIMAL,
  average_assessment_score DECIMAL,
  total_study_time INT,
  learning_streak_days INT,
  skill_level_progression JSON,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP
);

achievements (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255),
  description TEXT,
  icon_url VARCHAR(500),
  criteria JSON,
  points INT
);

user_achievements (
  user_id INT,
  achievement_id INT,
  earned_at TIMESTAMP,
  PRIMARY KEY (user_id, achievement_id)
);

social_interactions (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INT,
  interaction_type VARCHAR(50), -- 'share', 'like', 'comment'
  target_type VARCHAR(50),      -- 'progress', 'achievement', 'course'
  target_id INT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Implementation Details

### Phase 1: Analytics Foundation (Week 1-2)
- Set up analytics database schema and data collection
- Implement basic progress tracking for courses and assessments
- Create foundation dashboard layout with routing
- Build core analytics API endpoints

### Phase 2: Visualization Components (Week 3-4)
- Develop interactive charts using Chart.js or D3.js
- Implement skill progression visualization
- Build performance trend analysis components
- Create responsive dashboard layout for mobile

### Phase 3: Social Features (Week 5-6)
- Implement achievement system with badges and points
- Build leaderboard functionality with privacy controls
- Add progress sharing capabilities to social media
- Create peer comparison features

### Phase 4: Advanced Analytics (Week 7-8)
- Implement predictive analytics for learning recommendations
- Build advanced filtering and date range selection
- Add export functionality for progress reports
- Create personalized insight notifications

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies
- **Task 003**: Course Player Interface - Required for course completion data
- **Task 004**: Assessment Engine - Required for assessment performance metrics
- **Task 006**: Personalization Engine - Required for recommendation data integration

### External Dependencies
- Chart.js or D3.js library for data visualization
- Analytics service integration (Google Analytics or custom)
- Social media sharing APIs (Twitter, LinkedIn)
- Email service for progress notifications

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Functionality
- [ ] User can view comprehensive learning progress dashboard
- [ ] Interactive charts display course completion and assessment performance
- [ ] Achievement system tracks and displays user milestones
- [ ] Leaderboard shows peer comparisons with privacy controls
- [ ] Progress sharing works across major social media platforms
- [ ] Dashboard is fully responsive on mobile devices

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Dashboard loads in under 3 seconds with full data
- [ ] Real-time updates for progress tracking
- [ ] Analytics data accuracy validated against source data
- [ ] Social features respect user privacy settings
- [ ] Export functionality works for progress reports
- [ ] Notifications system for achievements and milestones

### Quality Assurance

- Social sharing integration with external APIs
- Achievement system integration with course/assessment data
- Real-time progress updates validation

### User Acceptance Tests
- Complete user journey through dashboard features
- Social sharing workflow validation
- Achievement earning and display verification
- Mobile experience testing across devices

## Effort Estimate
- **Size**: L (Large)
- **Time**: 8 weeks
- **Complexity**: High - Complex data visualization and social features
- **Risk**: Medium - Integration with multiple services and external APIs

## Technical Notes

### Performance Considerations
