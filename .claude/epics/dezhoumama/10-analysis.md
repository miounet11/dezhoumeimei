# Issue #10 Analysis: Personalization Engine

## Parallel Work Streams

### Stream A: Database Schema & User Profiling System
**Files:** `prisma/schema.prisma`, `lib/db/queries/personalization-queries.ts`
**Work:**
- Create database migration for user profiles, learning paths, recommendations tables
- Implement user profile analysis service with behavior tracking
- Build preference learning algorithms and skill progression tracking
- Set up data collection endpoints for user interactions

### Stream B: Recommendation Engine & ML Models
**Files:** `lib/personalization/`, `app/api/personalization/`
**Work:**
- Implement collaborative filtering for strategy recommendations
- Build content-based filtering for game and course suggestions
- Create hybrid recommendation system combining multiple approaches
- Develop real-time preference updating and learning velocity tracking

### Stream C: UI Personalization & Adaptive Interface
**Files:** `components/personalization/`, `app/(authenticated)/personalization/`
**Work:**
- Build dynamic dashboard customization system
- Implement adaptive UI components based on play style
- Create personalized tutorial system with skill-based guidance
- Develop context-aware help system and progress visualization

### Stream D: Testing & Integration
**Files:** `tests/personalization/`, integration with existing systems
**Work:**
- Write comprehensive tests for profiling system (unit + integration)
- Test recommendation accuracy and performance
- Validate UI adaptation logic across different user profiles
- Performance testing with large datasets and concurrent users

## Coordination Rules
- Stream A creates database schema first (critical path)
- Stream B can start ML models in parallel with Stream A
- Stream C depends on Stream A's profile structure but can build UI scaffolding early
- Stream D tests each stream's output independently, then integration
