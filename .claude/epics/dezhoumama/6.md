# Task 003: Course Player Interface

## Overview

Develop a comprehensive course player interface that delivers an engaging learning experience for students. This includes video/text content rendering with progress tracking, interactive elements, assessment integration, and seamless navigation. The player will provide a modern, responsive learning environment that adapts to different content types and learning preferences.

## Technical Requirements

### Core Player Components

#### Video Player Features
```typescript
// Video player capabilities
- Custom video controls with branding
- Playback speed adjustment (0.5x to 2x)
- Quality selection (adaptive streaming)
- Subtitle/caption support
- Chapter markers and navigation
- Picture-in-picture mode
- Keyboard shortcuts for accessibility
- Auto-resume from last position
- Offline viewing capability (progressive web app)
```

#### Content Renderer
```typescript
// Content types supported
interface ContentBlock {
  type: 'video' | 'text' | 'interactive' | 'assessment' | 'code' | 'image';
  data: {
    content: string | VideoData | InteractiveData;
    metadata: ContentMetadata;
    interactions: InteractionConfig[];
  };
}

// Interactive elements
- Clickable hotspots on videos
- Interactive poker hand scenarios
- Code examples with syntax highlighting
- Quizzes embedded within content
- Discussion prompts and reflection questions
```

### User Interface Design

#### Player Layout
```typescript
// Component structure
CoursePlayer
├── PlayerHeader (course info, progress)
├── MainContent
│   ├── VideoPlayer | TextRenderer | InteractiveContent
│   ├── ProgressIndicator
│   └── InteractionOverlay
├── Sidebar
│   ├── ChapterNavigation
│   ├── Notes & Bookmarks

  interactions: InteractionEvent[];
  bookmarks: Bookmark[];
  notes: StudentNote[];
  assessmentScores: AssessmentResult[];
}

// Granular tracking
