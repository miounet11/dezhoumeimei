# Task 8 Analysis: Assessment Engine

## Parallel Work Streams

### Stream A: Database & API Foundation
**Scope**: Assessment data layer and core API endpoints
**Files**: 
- `prisma/migrations/*assessment*.sql` - Database schema
- `src/lib/db/queries/assessments.ts` - Database operations
- `src/pages/api/assessments/**` - API routes
- `src/types/assessment.ts` - TypeScript interfaces

**Work**:
1. Create assessment database tables (assessments, assessment_questions, user_assessments)
2. Implement Prisma schema extensions
3. Build core API endpoints for assessment CRUD operations
4. Add API endpoints for question management and submission
5. Implement skill analytics API endpoints

**Estimated Duration**: 3-4 weeks
**Dependencies**: Requires completed course schema from Task 1

### Stream B: Assessment Frontend Components  
**Scope**: User-facing assessment interface and experience
**Files**:
- `src/components/assessment/**` - Assessment UI components
- `src/pages/assessments/**` - Assessment pages
- `src/hooks/useAssessment.ts` - Assessment state management
- `src/styles/assessment.module.css` - Assessment styling

**Work**:
1. Build assessment-taking interface with timer and navigation
2. Create different question type components (multiple choice, scenario, hand analysis)
3. Implement results dashboard with skill breakdown visualization
4. Add progress indicators and review capabilities
5. Ensure mobile responsive design

**Estimated Duration**: 3-4 weeks  
**Dependencies**: Needs API endpoints from Stream A

### Stream C: GTO Integration & Scoring
**Scope**: Advanced assessment logic and GTO system integration
**Files**:
- `ai-service/assessment/` - Assessment AI service components
- `src/lib/assessment/scoring.ts` - Scoring algorithms
- `src/lib/assessment/adaptive.ts` - Adaptive testing logic
- `src/lib/assessment/gto-integration.ts` - GTO solver integration

**Work**:
1. Integrate with existing GTO solver for hand evaluation
2. Implement adaptive testing algorithms
3. Build scoring and skill profiling logic
4. Create assessment analytics and performance tracking
5. Add cheating prevention mechanisms

**Estimated Duration**: 4-5 weeks
**Dependencies**: Requires existing GTO solver and Stream A APIs

## Integration Points

- **Stream A → B**: API endpoints must be completed before frontend development
- **Stream A → C**: Database schema needed for advanced scoring logic
- **Stream B ← C**: Frontend needs scoring results from GTO integration
- **All Streams**: Final integration and testing phase

## Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: GTO integration complexity may require additional time
- **Medium Risk**: Adaptive testing algorithms may need iterative refinement  
- **Low Risk**: Database schema is well-defined and straightforward

## Success Criteria

- All three streams integrate seamlessly
- Assessment interface is intuitive and responsive
- GTO integration provides accurate skill evaluation
- Performance meets specified benchmarks (≤2s results calculation)
- System supports concurrent users without degradation
