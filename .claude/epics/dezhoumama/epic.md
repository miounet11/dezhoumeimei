# Epic: dezhoumama

## Overview

Technical implementation of dezhoumama德州扑克学习平台, focusing on leveraging existing PokerIQ Pro v1.0.2 architecture while adding comprehensive course content, assessment system, and AI-powered virtual character interactions. This epic prioritizes content management infrastructure and extends existing training/AI systems rather than rebuilding from scratch.

## Architecture Decisions

### Content Management Strategy
- **Leverage existing database schema**: Extend current PostgreSQL tables rather than creating parallel content system
- **File-based course storage**: JSON/Markdown hybrid for course content with database metadata for performance
- **CDN integration**: Use existing infrastructure patterns for video/media content delivery
- **Assessment engine**: Build on existing GTO evaluation system for skill testing

### AI Integration Approach
- **Extend existing AI opponents**: Enhance current 8-style system to include conversational avatars
- **Unified AI service**: Consolidate GTO solving, opponent modeling, and conversation into shared FastAPI service
- **Character personality system**: Rule-based + LLM hybrid for consistent virtual character interactions

### Technology Stack Consistency
- **Frontend**: Continue with Next.js 15.4.6 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Extend existing Node.js API routes + Python FastAPI for AI services
- **Database**: PostgreSQL schema extensions + Redis for conversation state
- **Authentication**: Maintain existing NextAuth + JWT system

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Components
- **Course Player Component**: Video/text content renderer with progress tracking
- **Assessment Interface**: Interactive quiz/scenario testing with real-time feedback
- **Character Chat System**: Real-time conversation UI with avatar integration
- **Learning Dashboard**: Progress visualization and personalized recommendations
- **Responsive Design**: Extend existing Tailwind patterns for mobile optimization

### Backend Services

#### Content Management API
```typescript
// Extend existing API structure
/api/courses/[courseId] - Course content and metadata
/api/assessments/[testId] - Assessment questions and scoring
/api/progress/user/[userId] - Learning progress tracking
/api/recommendations/[userId] - Personalized learning paths
```

#### AI Services Enhancement
```python
# Extend existing FastAPI service
/ai/chat/character/{characterId} - Virtual character conversations
/ai/assess/skill/{userId} - Skill level evaluation
/ai/recommend/course/{userId} - Course recommendations
/ai/analyze/performance/{sessionId} - Performance analysis
```

#### Database Schema Extensions
```sql
-- Extend existing schema with new tables
courses (id, title, level, content_path, video_url, duration)
assessments (id, course_id, questions, scoring_config, difficulty)
user_progress (user_id, course_id, completion_rate, test_scores, last_accessed)
characters (id, name, personality_config, avatar_url, specialization)
chat_sessions (id, user_id, character_id, conversation_history, created_at)
```

### Infrastructure
- **Content Storage**: Leverage existing Docker + file system approach
- **Media CDN**: Integrate with existing static asset handling
- **Caching Strategy**: Extend Redis usage for course content and character conversations
- **Monitoring**: Use existing Sentry + logging infrastructure

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Content Infrastructure (4-6 weeks)
- Extend database schema for courses and assessments
- Build content management admin interface
- Implement basic course player and assessment UI
- Create content upload and organization system

### Phase 2: AI Character System (6-8 weeks) 
- Develop virtual character conversation engine
- Implement character personality and specialization system
- Build real-time chat interface with avatar support
- Integrate character recommendations with learning paths

### Phase 3: Personalization & Polish (8-10 weeks)
- Implement advanced skill assessment algorithms
- Build personalized learning path recommendations
- Add social features and progress sharing
- Performance optimization and user experience refinement

### Risk Mitigation
- **Content Creation Bottleneck**: Develop template-based content authoring tools
- **AI Conversation Quality**: Implement fallback to rule-based responses
- **Performance with Large Content**: Implement lazy loading and progressive enhancement
- **User Adoption**: A/B test key features and gather continuous feedback

### Testing Approach
- **Unit Tests**: Full coverage for content management and AI services
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end learning flow validation
- **Performance Tests**: Load testing for concurrent users and content delivery
- **User Testing**: Iterative testing with real poker players for content validation

## Task Breakdown Preview
